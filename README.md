Campus Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a Campus Network design and simulation created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates how a real-world college/university campus network can be planned, configured, and tested.

📌 Project Overview

A campus network connects multiple departments, labs, offices, and services within an educational institution. This simulation focuses on:

Department-wise network segmentation

Efficient IP addressing

Secure and scalable design

Inter-department communication



---

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Cisco Packet Tracer

Networking Devices:

Routers

Switches (Access & Distribution)

PCs / Laptops

Servers (optional)




---

🏗 Network Topology

The campus network includes:

Multiple Departments (e.g., Admin, CSE, ECE, Library, Hostel)

Core Router for inter-network communication

Access Switches for end devices

VLANs for logical separation

Static / Dynamic Routing (as per design)


> The topology is designed to reduce broadcast traffic and improve performance.

🌐 IP Addressing Scheme

Private IP addressing is used

Each department is assigned a separate network / VLAN

Example:


Department	Network	Subnet Mask

Admin	192.168.10.0	255.255.255.0
CSE	192.168.20.0	255.255.255.0
ECE	192.168.30.0	255.255.255.0

⚙️ Configuration Details

VLAN configuration on switches

Inter-VLAN routing using router / multilayer switch

IP address assignment to all end
